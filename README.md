# `The Weather App ðŸŒž`
Tired of not having a perfect desktop app allowing you to instantly see the current weather by just inputting your city name?
We have a solution for you right here!
As a part of our Project IV class we have decided to create a full-scale desktop weather application providing current weather details based on the city of the user's choice.
With the use of openWeatherMap API we can provide our users with the perfectly accurate weather data and an accurate forecast, as openWeatherMap is an initiative by IT-experts and data scientists, who are commited to deep data-science approach in weather analysis.
So, with the use of our new app you will always have access to the most accurate weather data, so never again you'll have to stand in the rain, while your weather app tells you it's sunny outside.
